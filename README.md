    I'm Valenciola!
    <br><br>
    I did things mostly related to JavaScript and web development. Now I've seen a multitude of programming languages, and I'm trying to figure out which one to keep the most knowledge in. 
    <br><br>
    I mostly come up with crazy ideas to make crazy internal web programs that somehow work??? Also I solve code puzzles sometimes :D
    <br><br>
    Anyway I think I do cool stuff and I have fun (after the debugging stage of course) :D
    <br><br>

    (Still learning some new programming stuff...)

> I'm currently focusing on web development and (soon) PHP. It's the kind of stuff I used to do when I was younger, so it's coming along pretty easily.

*I think I am a cool smart programmer kid*
