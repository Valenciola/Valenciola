    I'm Valerie!
    <br><br>
    I did things mostly related to JavaScript and web development when I first started out. Now I've seen a multitude of programming languages and their uses, and I'm trying to figure out which one to keep the most knowledge in. Currently, I've been making use of my web development languages and Python.
    <br><br>
    I mostly turn websites into things that are more than just websites.
    <br><br>
    I still have a lot to learn. I'm looking for an opportunity to make my education useful.
    <br><br>

    (You know, putting my knowledge to work and creating things...)

> I'm planning on overhauling this soon to make something a little more like myself. But thank you for stopping by; come back soon!
