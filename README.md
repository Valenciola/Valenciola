    I'm Valenciola!
    <br><br>
    I did things mostly related to JavaScript and web development when I first started out. Now I've seen a multitude of programming languages and their uses, and I'm trying to figure out which one to keep the most knowledge in. Maybe I'll just specialize in more than one?
    <br><br>
    I mostly come up with crazy ideas to make crazy internal web programs that somehow work??? Also I solve code puzzles sometimes :D
    <br><br>
    Anyway I think I do cool stuff and I have fun (after the debugging stage of course) :D
    <br><br>

    (Putting my knowledge to work and creating things...)

> I'm currently using web development in an intentionally unconventional way. It's strange, but things are always looking up in the end.

*I'm an entire programmer student now*
