    I'm Valenciola!
    <br>
    I do things mostly related to JavaScript and web development. Lately, though, I've been learning some new languages. 
    <br>
    I mostly come up with crazy ideas to make crazy internal web programs that somehow work??? Also I solve code puzzles sometimes :D
    <br>
    Anyway I think I do cool stuff and I have fun (after the debugging stage of course) :D

    (Learning some new programming stuff...)

> I'm currently leaning C++ and Python and learning how to dodge the issues by running into them (it sounds counterintuitive but it works)

*I think I am a cool smart programmer kid*
