I'm Valenciola! I do things mostly related to JavaScript and web development. I mostly come up with crazy ideas to make crazy internal web programs that somehow work??? Anyway I think I do cool stuff and I have fun :D

*I might just be a cool smart programmer kid yet-*

```JavaScript
var level = 6;
var status = "On My Way";
var latestAchievement = "Text engine complete";
var nextGoal = "Animation with motion technique";
```
In games, I need to be able to animate moving objects for design and walk cycles. Of course, I need to make a program to animate first...

**Striving to learn some new programming stuff**
