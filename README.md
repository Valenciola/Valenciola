```JavaScript
var level = 5.5;
var status = "Simultaneously Street-Smart Programmer ProtÃ©gÃ©";
var latestAchievement = "W3Schools Research with Friends";
var nextGoal = "Implement my text engine into the web display :D";
```
My text engine works, and it's making me feel pretty good. Now, I can go on to the next step of implementation!

Thanks @RealStr1ke
